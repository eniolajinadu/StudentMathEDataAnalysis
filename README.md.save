 Introduction
This is my first project in data analysis, and I'm currently working with a dataset as I continue to learn and develop my skills in this field.

## CSV File Description
This CSV file captures data related to student responses on statistical questions, specifically focusing on the "Stem and Leaf diagram" and "Relative frequency." The dataset includes various attributes such as Student ID, Student Country, Question ID, Type of Answer, Question Level, Topic, Subtopic, and Keywords. The structure of the file is designed to facilitate analysis of student performance and understanding of basic statistical concepts.

## PY File Description
This Python script is designed for data analysis and visualization of a CSV dataset containing student responses related to statistical questions. The script employs libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` for data manipulation and visualization, while also utilizing chardet for encoding detection. Below is a breakdown of the key components and functionalities implemented in the script.

## Usage
To run the script, execute the Python file using Python version 3.9 or higher. The script will load the CSV file, conduct data cleaning and preprocessing, and produce various visualizations to analyze the dataset effectively.

## Requirements
*RECOMMENDED*:
Use `Anaconda` or `Jupyter` for best experience.

*Python:*
Version 3.9 or higher


*Required Libraries:*
`pandas`
`matplotlib`
`numpy`
`chardet`


Ensure that these libraries are installed in your Python environment before running the script.

## Contributing
Contributions to the script are welcome.
